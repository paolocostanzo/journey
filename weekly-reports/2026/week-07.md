# Week 7 - February 16-22, 2026

## 🎯 This Week's Focus

Launching my public cybersecurity journey! This week marks the beginning of my systematic approach to mastering offensive security. I'm currently deep in the **TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester** path, specifically working through the "Introduction to Web Hacking" module. The focus is on building foundational web application security skills while establishing my weekly writeup routine.

## 💡 Key Insight of the Week

> "Security testing is not about finding vulnerabilities—it's about understanding systems so deeply that vulnerabilities become obvious."

**Why it matters:** This week reinforced that effective penetration testing requires methodical reconnaissance and documentation, not just running automated tools. Understanding *why* a web application is structured a certain way helps predict where vulnerabilities might exist. This mindset shift from "hacking" to "systematic security assessment" is foundational for professional work.

## 🎓 Study Notes

### Technical Concepts Mastered
1. **HTTP Request Structure:** Understanding headers, methods, and parameters is crucial for identifying injection points
2. **Web App Architecture:** Client-server model, MVC pattern, and common technology stacks
3. **Reconnaissance Methodology:** Passive vs active information gathering, tools hierarchy

### Tools Used
- **TryHackMe AttackBox** - Cloud-based penetration testing environment
- **Burp Suite Community** - HTTP proxy for request interception and analysis
- **Browser DevTools** - Network tab analysis and DOM inspection

## 🐛 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge
Setting up a sustainable weekly workflow that balances learning, practice, documentation, and publishing without burning out.

### How I Solved It
Created a structured Sunday routine with clear time blocks:
- **Morning (2-3h):** THM practice and note-taking
- **Afternoon (2-3h):** Writeup creation and editing
- **Evening (1h):** Weekly report, repo updates, and planning

Having templates and automation scripts removes decision fatigue. Now I can focus on learning, not logistics.

## 🌱 English Progress (Duolingo)

- **Daily streak:** 7 days (Just started!)
- **XP earned this week:** 350 XP
- **Focus areas:** Technical vocabulary, business communication for remote work

**Why this matters:** Working remotely for USA/UK/EU companies requires excellent written English. Daily practice is non-negotiable for achieving $250-500/hour rates.

---

## ⏭️ Next Week's Goals

- [ ] Complete "Introduction to Web Hacking" module on THM
- [ ] Publish writeup on next web security concept (likely SQLi or XSS)
- [ ] Continue daily Duolingo (maintain 14-day streak)
- [ ] Start researching AWS Cloud Practitioner study materials
- [ ] Engage with 3-5 security writeups on Medium for community building

## 🎯 Reflection

This first week is about building momentum and establishing systems. The hardest part of any journey is starting, and I've crossed that threshold. Having a public repository creates accountability—every Sunday, I need to show up.

The transition from scattered learning to systematic documentation is powerful. When I publish my first writeup, I'm not just documenting what I learned—I'm building a portfolio that will help me land remote penetration testing contracts at premium rates.

**Key realization:** The journey to OSCP is long (30 months), but every week compounds. By month 17, I'll have 70+ writeups and real expertise. That's when freelance opportunities will open up.
